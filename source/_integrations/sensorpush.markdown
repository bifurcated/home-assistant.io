Integrates [SensorPush](https://www.sensorpush.com/) devices into Home Assistant.

## Supported devices

- [HT.w Water-Resistant Temperature / Humidity Smart Sensor](https://www.sensorpush.com/products/p/ht-w)
- [HTP.xw Extreme Accuracy Water-Resistant Temperature / Humidity / Barometric Pressure Smart Sensor](https://www.sensorpush.com/products/p/htp-xw)

The SensorPush integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional.

## App Configuration Required To See Entities
Sensor entities (temperature, humidity, baromatric pressure) will not be available to Home Assistant until you have configured them from within the SensorPush app on iOS or Android.  

Using the SensorPush app to configure sensors does not require creation of a SensorPush account or the provision of any information.  Communication between the sensor and Home Assistant will be purely local via BLE.
